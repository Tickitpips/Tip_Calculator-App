Understanding state hoisting in Android programming

This is not originally my code but I have embellished it with my comments to help understand state hoisting. The project is Google's Open Source project and can be found here: https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-tip-calculator/archive/refs/heads/state.zip

Many thanks to the developers who compiled the code
